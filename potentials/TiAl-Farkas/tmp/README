*  dianastomdcask code reads the interatomic
*  potential files from Diana Farkas
*  and writes an EAMDATA file that MDCASK 
*  can read

*  To run dianastomdcask  you need a file
*  called dianasfiles that has the names
*  of the potential files from Diana Farkas
*  The ORDER in the name of the files is 
*  very IMPORTANT. It should be:
*  phi11
*  phi12
*  phi22
*  rho1
*  rho2
*  Frho1
*  Frho2
*  where 1 and 2 are the two components

*  The EAMDATA file will have the cutoff 
*  as the largest of the cutoffs of the two
*  components.
